# Team 8 SWPP Project: You & Meet

## Branch management

- We will work in the ``dev`` branch when implementing features.
- Avoid pushing features directly into the ``dev`` branch. Create features in a separate branch, and submit a pull request. (Temporarily Philsik will manage the pull requests.)
- We will push the contents of the ``dev`` branch to the ``master`` branch at the end of each sprint.

## Repo structure

- ``/angular``: folder for frontend
- ``/django``: folder for backend
